# dotfiles
There are two scripts in install folder `environment.sh` and `system.sh` to build environment (dotfiles) and system (nix files) respectively. 
Those scripts expect me to be in dotfiles directory (so they can simlink all the stuff). I guess there should be a better way? 
But for now it should suffice.

TODO:
  * nix-env -q is not included.
  * nix-channel is not included too.
  * sleep better at night.

PS.
Yes, the wallpaper doesn't exactly have the best resolution, but wait! Try it with two terminals and `xcompmgr`. Yip.
